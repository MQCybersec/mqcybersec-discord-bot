# MQCyberSec Utility Bot

This bot is for MQCyberSec CTF participation, currently its pretty good but some setup advise:
- for whatever channel you want to send `/setupctf` to, make sure it has 'Embed Links' as well as the usual message perms (View Channel, Send Messages, etc) so it can send embeds
- The final bot permissions I used were: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&permissions=292326501456&scope=bot%20applications.commands` but its probably over-permissive

any questions or improvement send issue/PR
